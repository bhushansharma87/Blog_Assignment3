                        <p>According to the Sikh historical records, the land that became Amritsar and houses the Harimandir Sahib was chosen by Guru Amar Das, 
                            the third Guru of the Sikh tradition. It was then called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked his disciple Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man-made pool as its central point.
                            After Guru Ram Das succeeded Guru Amar Das in 1574, and in the face of hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das,Guru Ram Das founded the town that came to be known as "Ramdaspur". 
                            He started by completing the pool with the help of Baba Buddha (not to be confused with the Buddha of Buddhism). Guru Ram Das built his new official centre and home next to it.
                            He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle in the new town with him.</p>
                        <p>Ramdaspur town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The town grew to become the city of Amritsar, and the area grew into the temple complex).
                            The construction activity between 1574 and 1604 is described in Mahima Prakash Vartak, a semi-historical Sikh hagiography text likely composed in 1741, and the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus. Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new gurdwara in 1604.
                            Continuing the efforts of Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan established Amritsar as a primary Sikh pilgrimage destination. He wrote a voluminous amount of Sikh scripture including the popular Sukhmani Sahib.</p>

                    <div class="vb-text">
                        <p>Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of basketball too vigorous. 
                            Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of “volleyball.” 
                            The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America (1897).
                            The game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.</p>
                            <p>The Volleyball Federation of India was formed in the year 1951. Prior to the formation of the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI), the game was controlled by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and at that time the Interstate Volleyball Championship was held every two years from 1936 to 1950 for men only.</p>

            <h1>CRICKET</h1>
            <p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in south-east England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
                International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer).
                Internationally, cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.     
                The game's rules are defined in the "Laws of cricket". The game has various formats, ranging from one-day cricket played over a few hours to Test matches which can last up to five days</p>

                        <p>The hole in the Earth's ozone layer will be fully healed over most parts of the world within two decades, according to a report by the UN.
                            The hole in the Earth's ozone layer has been the worst apprehended environmental disaster.
                            The ozone layer is on track to be healed across the world except for polar regions by 2040. Over the Arctic, the Ozone layer will be healed by 2045. In case of Antarctic, it will take longer time till 2066.</p>
                        <p>The hole in the earth's ozone layer causes risk of people exposing to Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
                            In 1980s, scientists cautioned against loss of Ozone. 1989 Montreal protocol has proven to be critical as governments agreed to work together following a framework that aimed at reducing 99 per cent ozone-depleting chemicals mainly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
                            The UN has said that the course of action taken to heal ozone layer has acted against the uncontrolled use of CFCs.</p>
